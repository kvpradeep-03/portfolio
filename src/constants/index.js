export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I'm a full-stack web developer with experience in both front-end and back-end technologies. Right now, I’m focused on building modern, responsive web apps and learning how tech can be used to solve everyday problems. I enjoy working on personal projects, experimenting with new tools, and constantly improving my skills. Lately, I've also been diving into cybersecurity and thinking about how to build not just functional websites, but secure and scalable platforms. Whether it’s creating a social app like “Instagram” or brainstorming ideas for a SaaS product, I love bringing ideas to life through code.`;
